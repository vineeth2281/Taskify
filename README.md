ðŸš€ Introducing Taskify â€“ A Tiny MVP of My Imagination! ðŸš€


For the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve been trying to build Taskify, what I believe could transform the way we manage our daily tasks. Its a lightweight yet powerful task management tool designed to streamline productivity. This isnâ€™t just another to-do listâ€”itâ€™s a smarter way to organize tasks with AI-powered insights and automation.

ðŸ”¥ Key Features of Taskify:

âœ… AI Smart Tagging â€“ Automatically categorizes your tasks based on context.

âœ… Task Dependencies â€“ Understand how tasks are interconnected to prioritize effectively.

âœ… Priority Management â€“ A dynamic system that adapts as tasks evolve.

âœ… Interactive Calendar â€“ A visually intuitive way to plan and track progress.


Taskify is a small step toward my vision of making productivity effortless in a gamified way. Itâ€™s still an tiny MVP, but Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts!
